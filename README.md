Cipher is a program which takes the users input of a message and either decodes or encodes the message using the users 
choice of method (cipher).

Caear Shift 
is a cipher which moves the letters position in the message to the right a certain number to encode the message
and moves the position to the left a certain number to decode the message

encoding:
Moves each letter in message to the right of their position a certain number which is determined by the value of shift

decoding:
Moves each letter in message to the left of their position a certain number which is determined by the value of shift

Morse code 
is a cipher where each letter in the alphabet is a specific series of dots and/or dashes.
Words are separated by '|' and letters in each word are separated by '/'

encoding:
takes the user input of message_de and changes the word/s into morse code and returns the encoded message_de in morse code 
format

decoding:
takes the user input of message and changes the word/s (in morse code format) to normal text

The phonetic alphabet 
is 26 words that correspond with the 26 letters of the alphabet.
This means that each letter can be substituted for a phonetic word and vise versa.
In the phonetic alphabet the format is: words are separated by ". " and letters are separated by " "

encoding
takes word/s from user and converts them to phonetic words in the correct format

decoding
takes phonetic words from user and converts them to normal text
